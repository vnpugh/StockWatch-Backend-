Gain valuable insights, set personalized alerts, and track your favorite stocks with ease. With StockWatch, you can confidently make sound purchases when the time comes to invest in your first stock.
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
The Stockwatch API application is designed to provide backend functionality without the need for full CRUD operations and authentication. It utilizes Java RestAPI to handle the persistence of three models, allowing the API endpoints to perform CRUD tasks based on specific business use cases. In addition, the application includes a frontend built with Angular that communicates with the Spring Boot backend API, creating a comprehensive solution for managing stock-related data.
